Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

SOLUTION:

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N int) 
RETURNS int

READS SQL DATA

BEGIN
SET N=N-1;
SET GLOBLA log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
RETURN(SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET N);
END
