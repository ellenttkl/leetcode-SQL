Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

SOLUTION:

select s.Id, s.Company,s.Salary
from
(SELECT Id,Company,Salary,
		if(@prep=Company,@rank:=@rank+1,@rank:=1) as r, 
        @prep:=Company
from Employee, (select @rank:=0,@prep :=0) as temp
order by Company,Salary) as s
left join
(select Company, count(*) as count_num
from Employee
group by Company) as t
on s.Company=t.Company
where  (case when mod(t.count_num,2)=0 then s.r in(t.count_num/2,1+t.count_num/2) else s.r = ceil(t.count_num/2) end) 
;
