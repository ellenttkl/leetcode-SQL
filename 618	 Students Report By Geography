A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. 
The students' location information are stored in table student as below.
 
| name   | continent |
|--------|-----------|
| Jack   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jane   | America   |
 
Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. 
The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than
either Asia or Europe.
 
For the sample input, the output is:
 
| America | Asia | Europe |
|---------|------|--------|
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    |      |        |
 
Follow-up: If it is unknown which continent has the most students, can you write a query to generate the student report?

SOLUTION:

select America,Asia,Europe
from
(select @am:=0,@as:=0,@eu:=0) as t,
(select @am:=@am+1 as id, name as America
from student
where continent='America'
order by America) as america
left join 
(select @as:=@as+1 as id, name as Asia
from student
where continent='Asia'
order by Asia) as asia
on america.id = asia.id
left join
(select @eu:=@eu+1 as id, name as Europe
from student
where continent='Europe'
order by Europe) as europe
on europe.id = america.id
;
